YACache version 1.00
====================

Yet Another Cache is a short, simple cache for your Perl programs. The
Cache module collection already supports everything this module does, so
why another? Because this one is a lot simpler, faster and it's not OO.
It should be used preferably if you just want to store small structures
or scalars.

YACache is not OO, which means you don't need to initialize it and can
access the cache from anywhere in your program.

If you wish to use YACache for caching data, make sure you implement a
cache resize using your own logic. YACache does not keep last-access or
last-insert timestamps or any other metadata for that matter.
